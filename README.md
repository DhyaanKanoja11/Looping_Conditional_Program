#Taking Inputs

First off, it asks you to tell it a number - any number that comes to your mind! This number helps the program decide how many rows it should create.
Then, it wants to know something else from you - a word, a number, or whatever you fancy. This is the star of the show that will be repeated in a cool pattern.

#Creating a Pattern:

Now the fun part begins. The program starts to create a pattern using the number you gave as the range. It will make rows, and in each row, it'll print the word or number you told it earlier.
But wait, there's more! The number of times it repeats that word or number across the row depends on which row it's currently making. The first row will have it once, the second row twice, and so on.

#Adding Some Style:

The program also has a sense of style. Depending on which row it's working on, it might add a comma and space after the word or number. If the row number is less than or equal to 3, you'll see a comma. If it's 4 or higher, you'll still get that comma treatment.

#Wrapping Up:

Once the program finishes its artistic work, you'll see a fantastic pattern that mixes your input with some commas and spaces in a clever way. It's like a little collaboration between you and the program!


*So, in a nutshell, this code is all about creating a groovy pattern by repeating your input and adding a touch of flair with those commas and spaces. Give it a try and see what kind of masterpiece you and the program can create together! ðŸŽ¨ðŸŒŸ*
